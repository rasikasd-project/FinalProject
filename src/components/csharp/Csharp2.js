                    <h4>C# Variables and (Primitive) Data Types<hr/></h4>
                     <p>A variable is a symbolic name given to a memory location. Variables are used to store data in a computer program.</p>


                    <h5>How to declare variables in C#?<hr/></h5>
                    Here's an example to declare a variable in C#.
                    <div class="card card-body">
                         <pre>
                             {`int age;
`}
                         </pre>
                         </div>

 

                             

                    <h5>However, the variable can also be initialized to some value during declaration. For example,<hr/></h5>
                    
                    <div class="card card-body">
                         <pre>
                             {`int age = 24;

`}
                         </pre>      
                      </div>
<p>Here, a variable age of type int is declared and initialized to 24 at the same time.</p>


<h5>Since, itâ€™s a variable, we can change the value of variables as well. For example,<hr/></h5>
                    
                    <div class="card card-body">
                         <pre>
                             {`int age = 24;
age = 35;
`}
                         </pre>      
                      </div>

                    

                    
                      
                    
                     
                </p> 
             }
             />


        </div>
    )
}

export default Csharp1
